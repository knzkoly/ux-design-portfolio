##  Project Description

This project is a mobile app prototype for a Shopping-List application.  
It demonstrates user flows, UI design and basic UX concepts — aiming to provide an intuitive shopping list experience on mobile devices.  
The prototype is built in Figma and is meant to showcase UI layout, navigation flow, and general usability prior to implementation.

## Features & User Flows

- Add, edit and remove items from a shopping list  
- Mark items as “bought” or “pending”  
- Group items by categories (e.g. groceries, electronics, etc.) — *if applicable*  
- Clean, minimal and mobile-friendly user interface  
- User-friendly navigation and clear interaction design

## What I Learned / Why This Matters

- Practiced designing user flows and mobile UI layouts  
- Learned to think from the user’s perspective: clarity, simplicity, intuitive navigation  
- Gained experience of turning ideas into visual prototypes before any code  
- Demonstrated ability to use design tools (Figma) — useful when collaborating with developers/testers

## Notes

This is a design-first prototype. It shows:  
- ability to plan and design mobile UI/UX  
- understanding of user flow, layout, and usability  
- readiness to work with designers, developers, or as part of a QA / test environment  

If you’re looking for complete front-end or full-stack implementation, this prototype could serve as a base to build from.
